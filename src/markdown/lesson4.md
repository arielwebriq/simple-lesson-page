To install Gatsby and Node.js, it is recommended to use Homebrew. A little set-up in the beginning can save you from some headaches later on!

How to install or verify Homebrew on your computer:

Open your Terminal.
See if Homebrew is installed by running brew -v. You should see “Homebrew” and a version number.
If not, download and install Homebrew with the instructions for your operating system (Mac, Linux or Windows).
Once you’ve installed Homebrew, repeat step 2 to verify.
